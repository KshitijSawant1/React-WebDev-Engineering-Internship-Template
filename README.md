# React WebDev Engineering Internship Template – Finance Tracker [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)


## Overview

This is a **starter template** for a **React-based Finance Tracker** application, designed for engineering interns and web development learners. The project serves as a foundation for building modern, interactive, and user-friendly finance tracking applications.

In this internship module, learners will:

* Understand the **React project structure** and component-based development.
* Learn to integrate **backend APIs** for real-time data storage and retrieval.
* Explore **local storage** for offline-first capabilities.
* Implement **state management** for handling transactions and analytics.

This template is the starting point for our **Finance Tracker App**, which will evolve step-by-step during the training sessions.

## Features

* **Clean React Starter Setup** – Minimal code to start quickly.
* **Finance Tracker UI** – Ready-to-use basic components for transaction management.
* **Responsive Layout** – Mobile-friendly and adaptive design.
* **Local Storage Integration** – Store user data locally for quick retrieval.
* **Backend Ready** – Structured for API integration.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, JavaScript (ES6+), Tailwind CSS
* **State Management:** useState, useEffect (React Hooks)
* **Storage:** Local Storage API, Backend Integration (to be added)
